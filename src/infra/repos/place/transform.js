/**

 * @description
 * The thing about the transformation here is that it must link to the interface 
 * that supports hypermedia affordances. Here we want to present to the user all 
 * the geographical controls to manipulate a world-historical map. Amundsen developed
 * an example for a maze, but we present all of the affordances for an interactive map 
 * which can support autonomous automatic agents for the discovery layer of the 
 * periodic table of information. The web is a computational mode of an internet 
 * application as a computational occasion mutates the ingress of the transcendental 
 * conditions of its own self-actualization.
