# Task correctness with UML

In order to encourage effective completion of tasks and interdependent self-organization, 
we want to develop initiatives (later themes, stories, tasks, subtasks, 
comments, etc.) for project work from a graphical language like UML which all 
developers may operate autonomously from but may refactor in joint epistemic 
spontaneity as project paths converge and diverge over the lifetime of the 
self-organizing application imbued with co-evolving, non-interactive (low 
coupling), unversioned composable webbed components for person-2-person 
paradigmatic affordance.
