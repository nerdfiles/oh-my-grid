 * So in practice we design the interactive exteriority to the protocol. 
 * Amundsen recommends that instead of think in terms of designing "data APIs" 
 * we dress endpoints with features to be discovered algebraically (off-by-
 * one) and asynchronically/algorithmically; i.e., cache in-validating the link 
 * relations we know about through their names; or, rather: not (just) their 
 * names.
 *
 * Obviously my peculiar hyphen-use above will seem odd, perhaps even 
 * sociopathic to you. I assure you, it's no less peculiar than 
 * rms's departure from the inner world-thought. Assuredly, then, 
 * the web is the most hostile development environment imaginable 
 * and solving the "hard problems" of computer science, executable 
 * philosophy, is *best* solved openly: source-being as much as view-
 * viewing emerges in the viewing of the source with our tools, 
 * making these capabilities, relations, attributes, presentations, 
 * and toy temporalities available, addressable, and accessible, in 
 * our ontologies (OWL-Time, etc.), structures (ODRL, etc.), phenomenal 
 * thought (), and teleonomic designs. There is no private proof.
 *
 * Welcome to the realm of discoverable noise.
 *
 * HTTP OPTIONS can hand between categories of API metacomputational tasks 
 * through link relations on resources representing the k8s, consul, etc. 
 * metaresource stacks, annotated with downward causal relations determined 
 * from perceptual and paradigmatic relations preprogrammed to the hyperschema
 * of the resource in their gradient of semioticity, medium specificity and 
 * metastability of holo-entropy features in semantics-driven design.
